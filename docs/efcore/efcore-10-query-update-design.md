# EF Core 10 Query and Update Pipeline

## Scope and evidence

This is the runtime query and tracked-update part of implementation Task 4. Database creation, live server
execution, transactions, complete scalar mappings and package validation remain required work in the
[feature checklist](efcore-10-feature-checklist.md). SQL-generation tests and intercepted commands do not prove
that a server accepts the SQL, generates identity values or commits and rolls back correctly.

## EF Core 10 contracts

The implementation was checked against the EF Core Relational 10.0.0 assembly and these upstream sources:

- [Provider implementation guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/writing-a-provider).
- [Relational service registration](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v10.0.0/src/EFCore.Relational/Infrastructure/EntityFrameworkRelationalServicesBuilder.cs).
- [Query SQL generator](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v10.0.0/src/EFCore.Relational/Query/QuerySqlGenerator.cs).
- [Update SQL generator](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v10.0.0/src/EFCore.Relational/Update/UpdateSqlGenerator.cs).
- [Generated-value propagation](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v10.0.0/src/EFCore.Relational/Update/ColumnModification.cs).
- [Relational command execution parameters](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v10.0.0/src/EFCore.Relational/Storage/RelationalCommandParameterObject.cs).

| Contract | EF10 lifetime | Implementation responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IProviderConventionSetBuilder` | Scoped | Extend `RelationalConventionSetBuilder` with its two dependency objects. |
| `IModelRuntimeInitializer` | Singleton | Use `RelationalModelRuntimeInitializer` to initialize relational model metadata. |
| `IModelCustomizer` | Singleton | Use `RelationalModelCustomizer` for relational model conventions and DbSet table naming. |
| `IModelValidator` | Singleton | Use `RelationalModelValidator` for the relational model boundary. |
| `IQuerySqlGeneratorFactory` | Singleton | Create a generator using `QuerySqlGeneratorDependencies` and the configured mode. |
| `IUpdateSqlGenerator` | Singleton | Use `UpdateSqlGeneratorDependencies` and the configured mode to emit DML. |
| `IModificationCommandBatchFactory` | Scoped | Consume `ModificationCommandBatchFactoryDependencies` and context options. |
| `ModificationCommandBatch` | Per batch | Implement admission, completion, transaction requirements, sync/async execution and value propagation. |

All services are registered through `EntityFrameworkRelationalServicesBuilder.TryAdd` before
`TryAddCoreServices`. The builder maintains its own registration map; mixing direct service-collection mutations
with an already-created builder can cause core defaults to replace provider factories.

## Relational model and queries

Relational conventions and model initialization must run before translating a query. Table names on an otherwise
core-only model are insufficient: query translation requires the table mappings in the relational model.

The query generator retains EF10's relational handling of projection, predicates, joins and aggregates, and changes:

- MySQL paging to `LIMIT <count> OFFSET <offset>`. Offset without a limit uses MySQL's maximum unsigned 64-bit
  limit literal, `18446744073709551615`.
- Oracle table aliases to omit `AS`, and table-free scalar selects to include `FROM DUAL`.
- Oracle paging retains EF10's `OFFSET ... ROWS FETCH NEXT ... ROWS ONLY` syntax.

This does not claim complete function translation, Boolean translation, collection translation or compatibility of
every scalar mapping. Default Oracle strings now use NVARCHAR2(2000), with length/Unicode/fixed facets described
in the [technical baseline](efcore-10-technical-baseline.md). Larger Oracle strings still map to CLOB/NCLOB;
generating an order or group operation over LOB storage does not establish valid execution. Live mapping and query
evidence remains required before advertising support.

## Tracked writes

A modification batch contains one row operation. This permits command-level affected-row checks and keeps the
provider independent of the connector's multi-statement and multi-send options. EF's batch executor continues to
control transactions across multiple row operations.

Writes use `IRelationalCommand` and `RelationalCommandParameterObject` with `CommandSource.SaveChanges`. This
retains EF command diagnostics, interceptors, configured timeout and transaction attachment. Input parameters
carry the type mapping and current or original value selected by EF's column modification metadata.

| Mode | Generated-value path | Transaction requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL | Execute DML, then select generated columns by the mapped primary key on the same connection. A generated insert identity uses `LAST_INSERT_ID()`. | The batch requires a transaction whenever a follow-up read is needed. |
| Oracle | Execute DML with `RETURNING <columns> INTO :ob_out_0, ...` and typed output parameters. | Returning outputs are part of the single DML statement. |

MySQL readback requires a mapped key with at most one generated identity column; unsupported shapes fail while
building the batch, before executing DML. The currently supported generated identity types are int/long (or
converters with those provider types), without configured default values, default SQL or computed expressions.
Server-generated string keys and nonidentity numeric defaults are rejected; they cannot use LAST_INSERT_ID.
Default-only inserts use `INSERT INTO ... () VALUES ()` in MySQL and
`INSERT INTO ... (key) VALUES (DEFAULT)` in Oracle. Schema creation must establish the appropriate identity or
default mechanism; these commands do not create it.

Oracle output values are converted to the mapping's provider CLR type before applying a configured converter and
assigning through `IColumnModification.Value`, which publishes store-generated values through EF's update entry.
MySQL readback uses `IReadOnlyModificationCommand.PropagateResults`.

Update and delete conditions include the original key and concurrency-token values selected by EF. A result other
than exactly one affected row raises `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` with the affected entries. Provider exceptions
are wrapped in `DbUpdateException`; cancellation remains `OperationCanceledException`. An already-cancelled async
save fails before executing the batch's command.

Both provider-created and caller-owned connections are checked for compatibility-mode conflicts. A closed connection
without `ExpectedMode` receives the configured provider mode before opening. An already-open connection must agree
with that mode. MySQL requires `UseAffectedRows=false`: EF concurrency checks count matched rows, including a match
whose stored values do not change. A conflicting option is rejected before execution rather than silently changed.
Validation happens at construction, creation, replacement and opening boundaries; the DbConnection getter stays
safe for EF's disposal/reset paths after rejection. Locally tested ownership covers closed supplied and created
connections, including sync/async disposal; opened-connection ownership still requires live evidence.

## Verification and remaining gates

`SqlGeneratorTests` verifies both-mode quoting and paging, offset without a limit, joins, grouped aggregate SQL
and inserts without SQL Server `OUTPUT`.

`BasicRelationalTests` executes the real EF query and SaveChanges pipelines with connector commands. Test-only
interceptors suppress network I/O and provide controlled result readers, output parameters and affected-row counts.
The tests verify scalar materialization, input binding, generated-key propagation, insert/update/delete,
default-only inserts, concurrency conflicts and cancellation. They deliberately disable automatic transactions;
they provide no transaction or live server evidence.
Unsupported MySQL string/default-expression keys have sync/async regression tests asserting that rejection occurs
before any command is executed.

Still required for Task 4 and release:

- Implement database creation/existence and the documented `EnsureCreated`/`EnsureDeleted` profile.
- Verify generated keys against actual identity/default columns in both modes.
- Verify MySQL matched-row behavior on a live server; connector option conflicts are covered locally.
- Complete string, decimal, temporal, Boolean, binary and Guid mappings before advertising broad query support.
- Run real transaction commit/rollback and caller-owned transaction tests, including failure after DML/readback.
- Run the two-mode live functional matrix and record connector/server versions and transport settings.
- Extend specification tests and validate the packed NuGet consumer in Task 5.
